Description: A flexible geostatistical server for Multiple Point Statistics (MPS) simulations
 G2S (GeoStatistical Server) is a versatile framework designed to run stochastic
 simulations using state-of-the-art Multiple Point Statistics (MPS) algorithms.
 The framework enables users to run simulations in a generic way, independent
 of the code or programming language used, such as running C/C++ code using
 Python, MATLAB, and more.

 The G2S framework currently includes the following algorithms:
  - QuickSampling (QS): A robust and efficient pixel-based MPS algorithm for
    (un)conditional simulation, gap filling, and downscaling with continuous or
    categorical variables in any dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D, nD).
  - Narrow Distribution Selection (NDS): A specialized algorithm for simulating
    spectrally enhanced remote-sensed imagery, requiring an external variable
    (e.g., grayscale image) to control the simulation of colors.
