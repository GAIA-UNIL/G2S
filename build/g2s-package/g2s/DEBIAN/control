Description: Toolbox for geostatistical simulations.
 G2S (GeoStatistical Server) is a versatile framework designed to run
 stochastic simulations using state-of-the-art Multiple Point Statistics (MPS)
 algorithms.
 The G2S framework currently mainly includes the following algorithms:
  - QuickSampling (QS): A robust and efficient pixel-based MPS algorithm for
    (un)conditional simulation, gap filling, and downscaling with continuous or
    categorical variables in any dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D, nD).
  - Narrow Distribution Selection (NDS): A specialized algorithm for simulating
    spectrally enhanced remote-sensed imagery, requiring an external variable
    (e.g., grayscale image) to control the simulation of colors.
