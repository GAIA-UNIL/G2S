.SH NAME
g2s \- a utility to manage the G2S server and systemd service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g2s
.RI [ command ]
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B g2s
utility is used to manage the G2S server and its systemd service. G2S (GeoStatistical Server) is a versatile framework designed to run stochastic simulations using state-of-the-art Multiple Point Statistics (MPS) algorithms. The G2S framework currently mainly includes the following algorithms:
.IP \[bu] 2
QuickSampling (QS): A robust and efficient pixel-based MPS algorithm for (un)conditional simulation, gap filling, and downscaling with continuous or categorical variables in any dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D, nD).
.IP \[bu] 2
Narrow Distribution Selection (NDS): A specialized algorithm for simulating spectrally enhanced remote-sensed imagery, requiring an external variable (e.g., grayscale image) to control the simulation of colors.
.PP
It provides commands for starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling the server as well as managing the server's operation with various options.

.SH "SERVER OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-d
Run the server as a daemon.
.TP
.B \-To n
Shutdown the server if there is no activity after n seconds, 0 for âˆž (default: 0).
.TP
.B \-p
Select a specific port for the server (default: 8128).
.TP
.B \-kod
Keep old data. If the flag is not present, all files from previous runs are erased at launch.
.TP
.B \-age
Set the time in seconds after which files need to be removed (default: 86400 s = 1d).
.SH "ADVANCED SERVER OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-maxCJ n
Limit the maximum number of jobs running in parallel.
.SH EXAMPLES
Start the server:
.IP
.B g2s server
.PP
Start the server as a daemon:
.IP
.B g2s server -d
.PP
Start the systemd service:
.IP
.B g2s start
.PP
Enable the systemd service:
